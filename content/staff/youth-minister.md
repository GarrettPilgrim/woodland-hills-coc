  Jacob started working as the Woodland Hills youth and family minister in May
  2023. He has a strong passion for God's Word and for ministry. That passion
  led him to Freed-Hardeman University, where he graduated in May 2022 with a BS
  in Bible. It was there that he met and fell in love with Matti Poling, whom he
  married just a week after graduation.


  Jacob has done multiple youth ministry internships in Nashville, Tennessee and Conyers, Georgia. He is always seeking ways to improve his God-given talents to strengthen and grow the Lord's kingdom. He is an avid board game fanatic, but also enjoys video games and movies.

  Woodland Hills in April 2004, after leading at four churches in the Memphis
  and Millington areas for almost thirty years. He has conducted song leading

  Catholic mother and had attended Methodist and Presbyterian churches growing
  up. Dennis attended Columbia Christian in Portland, Oregon, and Oklahoma
